3. Importance of societal roles/hierarchy
   1. Do good for others and for the world (mohism)
   2. Importance of being or having a leader
   3. Universal love is important
4. The evolution of chinese philosophy also demonstrates human evolution.

   1. Interests
   2. Inner and outer sources of morality.

1. We are innately good. god gives us freedom of choice that makes us bad (mohist)
2. Univeral love and leader (Mohism)
3. This similarities might be the reason why we had islam in China.
4. Mohist philosophy does not clearly outline what good each individual must do. Some may say the prophets were in fact the philosopheres and not the rulers. 

## Ideas

- It taught me to **embrace change** rather than my true self (what if true self is messy). The goal of life should be to **break bad patterns** and train ourselves to **interact** better with those around us. I shouldn't be **passive**.
- Rituals enable us to interact with what is around us in a different way, thus breaking the patterns that dominate our behavior (e.g., role reversal in han dynasty).
- Instead of having predetermined and practical goals, I should be **spontaneous** and open to change.
- Strong similarities between islam and chinese philosophy
  - Need for universal love and son of heaven
  - Dao, the nameless, the beginning of heaven and earth

## Findings

- It does not ask big questions, rather **small questions** such as "how are you living your daily life?"
- It believes that **great change** only happens with the **mundane and doable** actions.
- It encourages you to look and **think inward** to find your true self. 

- We aren’t just who we think we are, we can work on becoming better people all the time. Confucious believed that if you stay true to that self and allow it to become your guide, **it constrains you**.
- It encourages us to let our **behaviors decide and lead our emotions**, not the other way around.
- It encourages changes. Mencius advised that we should work with the **shifts and detours** – chance conversations, experiences, interactions – that nurture an expansive life.
- See everything in the world as **connected** instead of distinct and divided (unity matters).
- Live your life as a **series of ruptures**, because that is what **changes** you over time.
- We are complex creatures constantly **pulled in different direction**s. It’s the small actions through which you conduct yourself that matter most in transforming yourself, and the world, for the better.

### Confucious

- Rulers should **set examples**, not order.
- People are **naturally good**, so they would follow the right path on their own.
- Philosophy of Li
  - It represents proper social behavior.
  - It bounds human beings and the spirits together in networks of interactives roles.
- Philosophy of Ren

### Daosim (Laozi)

- Daoists believed that Confucians, by insisting on a purely human Way, **exaggerated the importance of man** and failed to pay attention to the lessons which Nature has to offer about time and change, gain and loss, the useful and the useless.
- The only human actions which ultimately make sense are those which are in accord with the **flow of Nature**.
- Wu wei, which meant that no one should have excessive desires because such desires are bound to cause injury both to oneself and to others.
- As believers in the way of the natural, the Daoists characteristically favored the spontaneous and the simple.
- Laozi’s natural realm is a realm ‘**of becoming**’ rather than ‘of being.’ 

### Legalism

- People are **naturally evil**, and they need strict laws and discipline to become good.



Quran illustrates a clear and detailed picture of Heaven and Hell.
