## Lecture 1

Introduction so nothing much...

"Managers do the things right, leaders do the right things"

## Lecture 2

The CMMI model is not a process, it shows what to do not **how or who**

**Product life cycle**: a series of phases that represent the evolution of a product from concept to delivery and ultimately, retirement.

**Project**: a temporary endeavor with a beginning and an end

**Program**: a group of related projects *or* a means to gain benefits and control of related projects

**Portfolio**: a group of projects and programs related to a specific strategic objective.

**Functional Manager** controls resources!

## Lecture 3

**Process**: A series of activities directed towards a specific result.

Good managers spend more time on planning and less time on execution.

## Lecture 4

Requirements for a successful project: need for it, funds, and a strong will.

Financial values calculation:

1. Net present value (NPV) --- the higher the better
2. Return on investment (ROI) --- the higher the better
3. Internal Rate of Return (IRR) --- Makes NPV zero
4. Payback period --- the shorter the better

**Those who do the work should plan the work**

**CCB**: A formal group of people responsible for approving or rejecting changes to a project.
