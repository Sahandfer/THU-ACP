# SPM Notes

> These are my notes for the Software Process Management 2020 final exam.

## Process Group Outcomes

1. Initiation --- Project statement, Project charter
2. Planning ---  project management plan, WBS, scope, schedule, cost estimate
3. Monitoring --- progression, deviation
4. Execution --- action
5. Closing --- formal acceptance and closing documents

## Lecture 1

Introduction so nothing much...

"Managers do the things right, leaders do the right things"

## Lecture 2

The CMMI model is not a process, it shows what to do not **how or who**

**Product life cycle**: a series of phases that represent the evolution of a product from concept to delivery and ultimately, retirement.

**Project**: a temporary endeavor with a beginning and an end

**Program**: a group of related projects *or* a means to gain benefits and control of related projects

**Portfolio**: a group of projects and programs related to a specific strategic objective.

**Functional Manager** controls resources!

## Lecture 3

**Process**: A series of activities directed towards a specific result.

Good managers spend more time on planning and less time on execution.

## Lecture 4

Requirements for a successful project: need for it, funds, and a strong will.

Financial values calculation:

1. Net present value (NPV) --- the higher the better
2. Return on investment (ROI) --- the higher the better
3. Internal Rate of Return (IRR) --- Makes NPV zero
4. Payback period --- the shorter the better

**Those who do the work should plan the work**

**CCB**: A formal group of people responsible for approving or rejecting changes to a project.

## Lecture 5

**Product scope**: the features and functions that characterize a product, service or result.

**Project scope**: the work performed to deliver a product, service, or result with the specified features and functions.

**Deliverables**: a product created as part of a project.

**Scope**: has deliverables, requirements, boundaries, acceptance criteria

**Requirements**: a condition or capability that is necessary to be presented in a product, service, or result to satisfy a business need.

**Requirements traceability matrix (RTM)**: is a grid that links product requirements from their origin to the deliverables that satisfy them.

**WBS** : The process of subdividing project deliverables and project work into smaller, more manageable components. It includes **100%** of the work to be done.

The work package is the work defined at the lowest level of the WBS for which cost and duration can be estimated and managed.

**The scope needs to be validated after finishing WBS and scope management plan.**

**Scope Creep**: The tendency for project scope to keep getting bigger and bigger

## Lecture 6

**Milestone**: a significant point in the project.

**Rolling wave planning**: is an iterative planning technique in which the work to be accomplished in the near term is planned in detail, while the work in the future is planned at a higher level.

**Precedence Diagramming Method (PDM)**: A network diagramming technique in which boxes represent activities.

**SMART**: Specific, Measurable, Assignable, Realistic, Time-framed.

**Slack/Float**: *Affordable delay* --- the amount of time an activity may be delayed without delaying the next activity or the project finish date. 

## Lecture 7

**Profit margin**: ratio of profits to revenues.

**Sunk cost** is money that has been spent in the past.

**Calculations**:

1. UDP (Unadjusted Function Points) = weighted sum of inputs
2. DI (Degree of Influency) = sum of technical complexity factors
3. FP = UFP*(0.65+0.01 * DI)
4. LOC (lines of code) = Language factor * FP
5. Effort (E) = measured in person-month or person-year
6. Productivity (L) = LOC/E
7. H-resources (P) =  E/T (average number of people delivering E)
8. Earned value (EV) = PV (planned value) *RP
9. Cost variance (CV) = EV - AC
10. Schedule variance (SV ) = EV - PV
11. Cost performance index (CPI) = EV / AC
12. Schedule performance index (SPI) = EV/ PV
13. Estimate at completion (EAC) = BAC / CPI
14. Estimate to complete (ETC)  = EAC - AC

## Lecture 8

**Power/Interest grid**:

1. Low interest - low power --- Monitor
2. Low interest - High power --- Keep Satisfied
3. High interest - low power --- Keep informed
4. High interest - High power --- Manage closely

**Engagement levels**:

1. Unaware
2. Resistant
3. Neutral
4. Supportive
5. Leading

**Tools to engage stakeholders**: Expectation Management Matrix and Issue Log

## Lecture 9

Fitness for use means a product can be used as it was intended

**Scope aspects affecting quality**:

1. Functionality
2. System outputs
3. Performance
4. Reliability
5. Maintainability

**Manage quality includes quality assurance as well as product design improvements.**

**Outcomes of control quality**:

1. Acceptance
2. Rework
3. Process adjustments

In control chart, if there are 7 outliers, **you should examine the process.**

sample size = 0.25 * (certainty factor/ acceptable error)^2

**DMAIC**: Define, measure, analyze, improve, control

## Lecture 10

**RACI**: Responsibility, Accountability, Consultation, Informed.

**Tuckman Team development model**:

1. Forming
2. Storming
3. Norming
4. Performing
5. Adjourning

**Team development**: training, team-building activities, reward and recognition system.

**Maslow hierarchy of needs**: self-actualization, esteem, love, safety, psychological.

## Lecture 11

Number of communication channels = n(n-1)/2

## Lecture 12

**Risk**: An uncertainty that can have a negative or positive effect on meeting project objectives. Risk is the product of probability and consequence.

Levels of risk: individual and overall project risks.

Types of risk: event or non-event risks.

**Risk utility**: Risk utility is the amount of satisfaction or pleasure received from a potential payoff.

**Contingency** plans are predefined actions that the project team will take if an identified risk event occurs. 

**Fall back** plans are developed for risks that have a high impact on meeting project objectives, and are put into effect if attempts to reduce the risk are not effective.

**Contingency reserves** or allowances are provisions held by the project sponsor or organization to reduce the risk of cost or schedule overruns to an acceptable level.

**Management reserves** are funds held for unknown risks

Categories of risk:

1. Market
2. Financial
3. Technology
4. People
5. Structure/process

**Estimated monetary value (EMV)**: is the product of a risk event probability and the risk eventâ€™s monetary value.

**Residual risks** are risks that remain after all of the response strategies have been implemented.

**Secondary risks** are a direct result of implementing a risk response.

## Lecture 13

Types of contract:

1. Fixed-price: set a total price for the product.
   1. Firm fixed price (FFP)
   2. Fixed price incentive fee (FPIF)
   3. FPEPA
2. Cost-reimbursable
   1. Cost plus fixed fee (CPFF)
   2. Cost plus incentive fee (CPIF)
   3. Cost plus award fee (CPAF)
   4. Cost plus percentage (CPPC)

*RFI*: request for information

*RFQ*: request for quotes

*RFP*: request for proposals

A **statement of work** is a description of the work required for the procurement.

## Lecture 14

PRINCE2 has 4 aspects: processes, themes, principles, environment.
