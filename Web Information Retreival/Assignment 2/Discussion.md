# Web Information Retreival - Assignment 2
In this assingment, we were tasked to annotate search results obtained from Assignment 1. Accordingly, we were asked to answer a series of questions.

### Q1: Is it difficult to annotate the relevance of a result?

For results that I annotate, It was fairly simple as I was familiar with the assigned queries. Therefore, I had a fairly familiar idea of what the results should look like.

### Q2: Is relevance annotation subjective or objective?

I believe the answer for this question depends on the search query. For instance, annotating results for commonsense knowledge, such as the query "How many days are in a year?", could be objective as many people have a mutual understanding of this topic. However, more specific queries, such as use-cases for certain coding libraries or frameworks would be subjective, as the person who creates the query must be satisfied with the results, thus making them the most suitable judge of the results' relevance.

### Q3: What are the factors that affect your relevance annotation for a page?

My prior knowledge of the topic and the word overlap between the query and search results.

### Q4: What are the differences when you annotate the relevance of a result based on snippet or landing page?

Since all of the results that I annotated were from Google, I saw little differences between the Snippet and the landing page, as Google already does a great job of highlighting the most relevant parts of the landing page in its snippets.

### Q5: Other thoughts

Interested to see how the annotation results will be used in the future.
