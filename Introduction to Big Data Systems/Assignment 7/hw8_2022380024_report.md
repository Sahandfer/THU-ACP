## Graph Partitioning

<div style="text-align: justify">Graph partitioning plays a vital role in reducing communication and ensuring load balance. In this assignment, we were tasked to implement 4 widely-used graph partitioning strategies, process 3 graphs and report the obtained results.</div>

### Preliminaries

<div style="text-align: justify">In this assignment, we create a data structure to store information regarding each machine: number of edges, number of vertices, number of replicated edges (in case of edge-cut) and whether the master version of a vertice exists in the machine. </div>

```c++
struct Partition
{
    int num_edges;
    int num_vertices;
    int num_rep_edges;
    int num_masters;
};
```

<div style="text-align: justify">Therefore, before starting each of the partitioning algorithms, we create n partitions, where n is the number of machines as provided by the user, as follows: </div>

```c++
vector<Partition> partitions;
for (int i = 0; i < num_partitions; i++)
{
  Partition p;
  p.num_edges = 0;
  p.num_vertices = 0;
  p.num_rep_edges = 0;
  p.num_masters = 0;
  partitions.push_back(p);
}
```

<div style="text-align: justify">In addition, at the beginning of each algorithm, we find the highest vertex id in the dataset through an initial pass. Accordingly, we use this value to initialize a vector that keeps track of the partitions that a certain has been assigned: </div>

```c++
// This function finds the max degree vertex in the dataset
int find_max_vertice(char *input_file)
{
    FILE *fin = fopen(input_file, "rb");
    int max_vertice = 0;
    while (true){
        // Get vertices ID
        int src_id, dst_id;
        if (fread(&src_id, sizeof(src_id), 1, fin) == 0)
            break;
        if (fread(&dst_id, sizeof(dst_id), 1, fin) == 0)
            break;
        max_vertice = max({max_vertice, src_id, dst_id});
    }
    fclose(fin);
    return max_vertice;
}

vector<set<int> > graph;
int max_vertice = find_max_vertice(input_file);
for (int i = 0; i <= max_vertice; i++)
{
  graph.push_back(set<int>());
}
```

<div style="text-align: justify">We count the total number of vertices for each machine based on the number of vertices that were assigned to this partition in the graph map and assign masters to their respective partitions based on the hashing function.  </div>


```c++
for (int i = 0; i <= max_vertice; i++){
  if (graph[i].size()){
    partitions[i % num_partitions].num_masters++;
    for (auto it = graph[i].begin(); it != graph[i].end(); ++it)
      partitions[*it].num_vertices++;
  }
}
```

<div style="text-align: justify">To decrease the memory requirements and runtime of the implemented algorithms, we process the edges as they are read from the file rather than storing them. </div>

### Balanced Edge-cut

<div style="text-align: justify">The edge-cut algorithm is fairly trivial. For each edge, there is a source and a destination vertice. Each vertice is placed on a partition randomly (vertice_id % # partitions). Accordingly, the vertices are considered as the master version upon this assignment. For an edge with id i, we have the following: </div>

```c++
// Get vertices ID
int src_id, dst_id;
if (fread(&src_id, sizeof(src_id), 1, fin) == 0)
  break;
if (fread(&dst_id, sizeof(dst_id), 1, fin) == 0)
  break;
// Find corresponding partition
int src_par = src_id % num_partitions;
int dst_par = dst_id % num_partitions;
// Add an edge to each partition
partitions[src_par].num_edges++;
partitions[dst_par].num_edges++;
// Add partition to the map for each vertice
graph[src_id].insert(src_par);
graph[dst_id].insert(dst_par);
```

<div style="text-align: justify">Accordingly, if the source and destination vertices are assigned to the same partition, we have a duplicate edge that needs to be removed. Otherwise, a replicate of each vertice would be created on the other partition and the resulting edge would also be added to the new partition, as follows:</div>

```c++
// Duplicate edge
if (src_par == dst_par)
  partitions[src_par].num_edges--;
else{
  graph[src_id].insert(dst_par);
  graph[dst_id].insert(src_par);
  partitions[src_par].num_rep_edges++;
  partitions[dst_par].num_rep_edges++;
}
```

### Balanced Vertex-cut
<div style="text-align: justify">Vertex-cut distributes the edges by first assigning each edge an id and assigning it to a partition randomly(edge_id % number of partitions). Then, similar to edge-cut, a master version of each vertice is created in their own randomly assigned partition (vertice_id % # partitions). Accordingly, a replica of each vertice is created in the edge's assigned partition.</div>

```c++
// Get vertices ID
int src_id, dst_id;
if (fread(&src_id, sizeof(src_id), 1, fin) == 0)
  break;
if (fread(&dst_id, sizeof(dst_id), 1, fin) == 0)
  break;
// Find corresponding partition
int src_par = src_id % num_partitions;
int dst_par = dst_id % num_partitions;
// Get edge partition
int edge_par = edge_id % num_partitions;
partitions[edge_id].num_edges++;
// Add edge and source partition for source vertice
graph[src_id].insert(src_par);
graph[src_id].insert(edge_id);
// Add edge and destination partition for destination vertice
graph[dst_id].insert(dst_par);
graph[dst_id].insert(edge_id);
// Increase id to point to next edge
edge_id++;
// Reset ids
if (edge_id % num_partitions == 0) edge_id = 0;
```

<div style="text-align: justify">To prevent the edge_id from reaching higher values that do not fit on memory, we reset the edge_id once a full cycle of edge assignment has been conducted on all machines.</div>

### Greedy Vertex-cut
<div style="text-align: justify">Based on the PowerGraph paper, instead of randomly cutting vertices and assigning edges, we could implement the following heuristics for greedy vertex-cut: </div>

<div style="text-align: justify">Case 1: If both source and destination vertices have been assigned to a number of partitions and there is an interesection, then the edge is assigned to a partition in the intersection. <br/>Case 2: If both source and destination vertices have been assigned to a number of partitions and there is an interesection, then the edge is assigned to one of the partititions from the vertex with the most unassigned edges.<br/>Case 3: If only one of the two vertices has been assigned to a partition, then the edge is assigned to one of the vertice's assigned partitions. <br/>Case 4: If neither vertex has been assigned, then the edge is assigned to the least loaded machine.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">In our implementation, we combined cases 2 and 3 as follows: First, as both vertices have to be initially assigned for an intersection to exist, the first case would be that there is an intersection; Accordingly, since if both vertices are assigned and have no intersection, or only one is assigned, demonstrate similar outcomes, we use this condition to represent cases 2 and 3 and assign the edge to the least loaded machine in the union of the assigned partitions. If neither vertice is assigned, we assign the edge the least loaded partition.</div>

```c++
// Get vertices ID
int src_id, dst_id;
if (fread(&src_id, sizeof(src_id), 1, fin) == 0)
  break;
if (fread(&dst_id, sizeof(dst_id), 1, fin) == 0)
  break;
// Find corresponding partitions
int src_par = src_id % num_partitions;
int dst_par = dst_id % num_partitions;
// Find intersection
vector<int> intersection;
set_intersection(graph[src_id].begin(), graph[src_id].end(), graph[dst_id].begin(), graph[dst_id].end(), back_inserter(intersection));
// Case 1
if (intersection.size()){
  int intersect = intersection[0];
  partitions[intersect].num_edges++;
}
// Cases 2 and 3
else if (!graph[src_id].empty() || !graph[dst_id].empty()){
  int min = INT_MAX;
  int min_idx = -1;
  bool from_src = true;
  // Find minimum partition from source
  vector<int> v_src(graph[src_id].begin(), graph[src_id].end());
  for (auto it = v_src.begin(); it != v_src.end(); ++it){
    if (partitions[*it].num_edges < min){
      min = partitions[*it].num_edges;
      min_idx = *it;
    }
  }
  // Find minimum partition from destination
  vector<int> v_dst(graph[dst_id].begin(), graph[dst_id].end());
  for (auto it = v_dst.begin(); it != v_dst.end(); ++it){
    if (partitions[*it].num_edges < min){
      min = partitions[*it].num_edges;
      min_idx = *it;
      from_src = false;
    }
  }
  // Add edge to minimum partition
  partitions[min_idx].num_edges++;
  // If minimum partition is from source, add destination partition
  if (from_src){
    graph[dst_id].insert(min_idx);
  }
  // If minimum partition is from destination, add source partition
  else{
    graph[src_id].insert(min_idx);
  }
}
// Case 4
else {
  int min = INT_MAX;
  int min_idx = -1;
  // Find least loaded partition
  for (int i = 0; i < partitions.size(); i++){
    if (partitions[i].num_edges < min){
      min = partitions[i].num_edges;
      min_idx = i;
    }
  }
  // Add edge to least loaded partition
  partitions[min_idx].num_edges++;
  // Add vertices to least loaded partition
  graph[src_id].insert(min_idx);
  graph[dst_id].insert(min_idx);
}
```

<div style="text-align: justify">In addition, in contrast to other algorithms, we choose the first partition in the set of partitions that a vertice has been assigned to as the master version of the vertice. </div>

```c++
for (int i = 0; i <= max_vertice; i++){
  if (graph[i].size()){
    partitions[*graph[i].begin()].num_masters++;
    for (auto it = graph[i].begin(); it != graph[i].end(); ++it)
      partitions[*it].num_vertices++;
  }
}
```


### Balanced Hybrid-cut

<div style="text-align: justify">To reduce the overhead of vertex-cuts that depend on the replication factor, hybrid-cut analyzes the degree of vertices and focuses on reducing the replication factor for low-degree vertices.  </div>

```c++
// This function finds the in-degree of destination vertices
vector<int> find_degree(char *input_file, int max_vertice){
    FILE *fin = fopen(input_file, "rb");
    vector<int> degree(max_vertice + 1, 0);
    while (true){
        // Get vertices ID
        int src_id, dst_id;
        if (fread(&src_id, sizeof(src_id), 1, fin) == 0)
            break;
        if (fread(&dst_id, sizeof(dst_id), 1, fin) == 0)
            break;
        degree[dst_id]++;
    }
    fclose(fin);
    return degree;
}
vector<int> in_degrees = find_degree(input_file, max_vertice);
```

<div style="text-align: justify">Accordingly, in this algorithm, for low-degree vertices, we evenly assign in-edges to the partition that the destination vertice has been assigned. In addition, for high-degree vertice, the in-edges are assigned to the partitions of their source vertices. Therefore, for this algorithm, we track the number of in-edges for vertices when loading the input. </div>

```c++
// Get vertices ID
int src_id, dst_id;
if (fread(&src_id, sizeof(src_id), 1, fin) == 0)
  break;
if (fread(&dst_id, sizeof(dst_id), 1, fin) == 0)
  break;
// Find corresponding partitions
int src_par = src_id % num_partitions;
int dst_par = dst_id % num_partitions;
// Low-degree vertice
if (in_degrees[dst_id] <= threshold){
  graph[src_id].insert(dst_par);
  graph[dst_id].insert(dst_par);
  partitions[dst_par].num_edges++;
}
// High-degree vertice
else{
  graph[src_id].insert(src_par);
  graph[dst_id].insert(src_par);
  partitions[src_par].num_edges++;
}
```

### Results and Discussion
<div style="text-align: justify">Initially, we visualize the results of the four implemented algorithms in the following figure. As the edges are sorted based on vertice id in the provided sample, greedy cut would assign all edges and vertices to partition 0. Hence, we shuffled the sample beforehand.</div>

![graph](/Users/sahandsabour/Desktop/Tsinghua/Introduction to Big Data Systems/Assignments/Assignment 7/graph.png)
<div style="text-align: justify">Accordingly, we illustrate the changes in replication factors (#Total vertices/#Master vertices)of different partitioning algorithms for varying number of partitions, which indicates the ratio that vertices have been replicated across different machines, in the figure below. The threshold for hybrid cut was set to 3, 16, and 100 for the 3 datasets, respectively, based on initial observations of the dataset structure.</div>

![data](/Users/sahandsabour/Desktop/Tsinghua/Introduction to Big Data Systems/Assignments/Assignment 7/data.png)

<div style="text-align: justify">As shown in the above figure, it can be observed that in general, the replication factor for all algorithms increases with the number of partitions. Across the studied datasets, hybrid and greedy cuts perform considerably better than the trivial edge and vertex cuts. Although edge and vertex cuts obtain similar replication factors, edge-cut produces significantly replicated edges, which raises memory concerns. Regarding the comparison between greedy and hyrbid cuts, although the obtained results demonstrate that greedy cut outperforms hybrid-cut on all three datasets, the performance is highly dependant on how the input data's structure and how it is sorted. For instance, we can observe that the replication factor for greedy cut on the roadNet-PA dataset is almost 1 (i.e., nearly no replicas). It should be noted that due to the additional overhead of the case logic, the runtime of this algorithm is considerably longer than hybrid cut. Therefore, we can conclude that when choosing either hybrid or greedy cuts for graph partitioning the following trade-offs have to be considered: the runtime, the data structure, and tuning (for the hybrid-cut's threshold).</div>
