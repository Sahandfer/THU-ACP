## Q1

<div style="text-align: justify">As mentioned in the paper, a standard trivial solution to double-spending would be to leverage a trusted central authority, called mints, which acts as mediator third parties that overlook all transactions, such as banks. However, this is against the motivation for this paper. To remove the need for such third parties, the paper proposes to publicly announce all transactions (choice <b>D</b>) and requires a system for all participants to agree on a single ordered transaction history (i.e., proof-of-work in this paper). All transactions in this chain are signed with the payee’s private key and payer’s public key (choice <b>B</b>), as private keys are used to ensure ownership. In addition, in cases of double-spending, proof-of-work based on a one-CPU-one-vote peer-to-peer policy will decide the valid chain based on consensus (majority voting represented by the longest chain). </div>

## Q2

<div style="text-align: justify">As Section 5 of the paper mentions, new transaction broadcasts do not necessarily need to reach all nodes. The same applies to block broadcasts, as they also tolerate dropped messages. If a node fails to receive a block (e.g., due to network partition problems), it realizes it has missed the previous block when it receives the next one. Accordingly, it can request to receive the last missed block. This is based on the assumption that the broadcast reaches many other nodes, and thus, the block makes it into the chain.

## Q3

<div style="text-align: justify">Storing the hashes in a Merkle tree has two main reasons: efficiency and security. The paper mentions that once the latest transaction in a coin is buried under enough blocks, the spent transactions before it can be discarded to save disk space. To facilitate this without breaking the block's hash, they leverage a Merkle tree and store the block hash, which includes the root hash, the previous hash, and the nonce, in the tree's root. Doing so means the interior hashes need not be stored, which massively saves storage space. As demonstrated by their calculations, block headers without transactions would only account for 4.2MB per year, which is acceptable given the current storage systems. In addition, as proposed in section 8, this structure enables users to verify payments with only a copy of the block headers of the longest proof-of-work chain (i.e., fast and secure verification). With this structure, the user can get this copy by querying network nodes until they are convinced they have the longest chain and obtain the Merkle branch linking the transaction to the block it's timestamped in. The user does this not by verifying the transaction but by linking it to a place in the chain. If the network node accepts it, the blocks added after it would also confirm the network's acceptance. </div>
