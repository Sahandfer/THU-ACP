## Worse is Better

<div style="text-align: justify">What we can understand from this article is that simplicity should be prioritized in design. What the author means by <b>worse</b> is a design in which completeness, consistency (especially in the interface), and correctness would be sacrificed so that the design maintains its simplicity. Accordingly, the author mentions that this type of style, which performs worse in terms of the mentioned three aspects, would be faster to create, easier to improve upon, and more practical in applications. Hence, the author believes that worse is, in fact, <b>better</b> in comparison to the perfected designs and implementations that are expected from the MIT/Stanford style of design, which aims to create the right thing. To better illustrate this idea and explain the reason behind the title of this article, we can revisit the provided diamond-like jewel scenario. As the author suggests, the right thing takes forever to design, but it is quite small at every point along the way. Hence, a better way to design would be to first implement a proportion of the right thing (e.g., 50%). Accordingly, once the design gains users' acceptance and interest, there would be available resources and interest to improve the design so that it represents a significant proportion (e.g., 90%) of the right thing. </div>
